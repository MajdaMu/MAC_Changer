# MAC_Changer:

This program/s is created to make the manual process of changing a MAC address more efficient for most users who are not
familiar with changing their MAC addresses via the command line. The step by step available currently is made specifically 
for Debian based Linux distributions. 

# Versions:

There maybe multiple versions posted for the same program. When that happens the README file associated with the versions
will include information about the changes made to the original program. Typically, a new version will be created only when 
a security flaw is discovered in the code or a way to reduce repeated code but maintain the same functionality was discovered. 
Either way, the reason for the release of the new version will be included in the README file.
